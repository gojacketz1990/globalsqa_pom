# Locator Setup and Information

## Page Object Locators
All locators are housed in the individual page classes.  They will be defined as a list of tuples.  For example:

    username_locator = [
        ("name", "user-name"),
        ("id", "user-name"),
        ("xpath", "//input[@placeholder='Username']")
    ]

To get an element on the page, get_element(locators) is called which calls an internal _get_by_method to determine the 
locator_type to use from the LOCATOR_DICT, LOCATOR_DICT(locator_type) is returned. get_element will loop through the 
list of tuple locators until it finds the element and if found will return the element or return an error if the element 
is not found.  

get_element: 

    def get_element(self, locators):
      """Find a single web element using self-healing locators."""
        wait = WebDriverWait(self.driver,10)
        for locator_type, locator_value in locators:
            try:
                by_method = self._get_by_method(locator_type)
                element = wait.until(EC.presence_of_element_located((by_method, locator_value)))
                #print(f"Element found using locator: {locator_type}={locator_value}")
                return element
            except (NoSuchElementException, TimeoutException):
                print(f"Locator failed: {locator_type}={locator_value}")
                continue

        raise NoSuchElementException(f"Element not found using any of the provided locators: {locators}")

Which calls the _get_by_method and returns the locator By Method to use:

    def _get_by_method(self, locator_type):
        """Retrieve the Selenium By method for a given locator type."""
        if locator_type not in self.LOCATOR_DICT:
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid locator type: {locator_type}. Valid types are: {list(self.LOCATOR_DICT.keys())}")
        return self.LOCATOR_DICT[locator_type]

For example, "name" is the locator type and "user-name" is the locator value.
In the BasePage class we have defined a dictionary of all of the locator types and mapped them to the values:

    LOCATOR_DICT = {
        "id": By.ID,
        "name": By.NAME,
        "xpath": By.XPATH,
        "css": By.CSS_SELECTOR,
        "class_name": By.CLASS_NAME,
        "link_text": By.LINK_TEXT,
        "partial_link_text": By.PARTIAL_LINK_TEXT,
        "tag_name": By.TAG_NAME,
    }

The element is returned to the by get_element(s)
The locators are done this way to build in a self-healing functionality in the case that one or more of the locators has changed in the DOM (Document Object Model).
The get_element methods are an extension of find_element and will use the _get_by_method to locate the locator type value.
If an element is not found, the method will self-heal by using a second or third method to find the element.
This will work on any of the custom methods also (such as wait_presence_element and wait_and_click_element).
